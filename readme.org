** ðŸ’Š xst ðŸ’Š

=xst= is a [[https://st.suckless.org/][st]] fork with some patches applied and other goodies.

*** Breaking changes with 0.8.4

- =st.bold_font= option is now inverted; set =st.disablebold= to 1 to remove bold (additionally there is now disable{italic,roman})
- =st.reverse-cursor= renamed to =st.cursorbg=
- =st.mouseScrollLines= renamed to =st.scrollrate=

*** xst-specific stuff

- Loads settings from Xresources. See [[./.Xresources][the reference file]].
- Live-reloads settings from xrdb on USR1 signal (like termite)
- Has cursor blinking options (and can persistently blink while typing)
- A keybind alt+u for launching urls with =dmenu= + =xurls=
